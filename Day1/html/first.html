<!-- HTML -- Hyper Text Markup Language
Using this HTML we create a web page (or web document) which will be rendered in web browser
Web Browser its a software that loads files from a remote server(or from local disk) and
displays them to us-- it allows user interaction.

Browser displays content - which may be a static or dynamic content
Static content is that which doesn't change (such as images, texts etc)
Dynamic content is that which changes (such as if we want to send data to server and store it  somewhere in the file system or database)
To make web page dynamic we need to use JavaScript

Client -- webbrowser acts a client
Server -- is a machine where we have content to be display.
          This server is known as webserver which serves web contents
